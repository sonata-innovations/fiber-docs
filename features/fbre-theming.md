# FBRE Theming Guide

How to theme a form rendered by **FBRE** (`@sonata-innovations/fiber-fbre`) — from a one-line accent change to a full custom brand palette, light or dark.

> This is the canonical theming reference. It ships inside the `@sonata-innovations/fiber-fbre` package (`docs/features/fbre-theming.md`), so the copy you are reading matches the version you installed. `fbre/README.md` carries a condensed summary; this document is authoritative.

---

## The mental model

FBRE's appearance is driven entirely by **CSS custom properties** (the `--fbre-*` tokens). Everything you see — every fill, border, label, and state color — resolves from one of these tokens. Theming is the act of supplying values for them.

There are **two independent axes**:

| Axis | Controls | Set via |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`style`** (FlowStyleType) | the *shape*: borders vs. underlines, fills, spacing, radius rhythm | `theme.style` (e.g. `"clean"`, `"defined-outlined"`) |
| **palette** | the *colors*: ground, surfaces, text, borders, accent, state colors | `colorScheme` + the palette knobs, or raw `--fbre-*` overrides |

`style` and palette are orthogonal: any style works with any palette. This guide is about the **palette** axis. (For the list of styles, see the [Flow Schema](../schema/flow-schema.md#style-types).)

---

## The precedence chain

Palette values resolve through four layers. Each layer overrides the ones above it, so you only specify what you want to change:

```
1.  Light defaults                    base.css  .fbre-container            (lowest)
2.  Preset:  colorScheme: "dark"      base.css  .fbre-container[data-mode="dark"]
3.  Knobs:   theme.{surface,text,…}   inline custom properties on the container
4.  Raw CSS: your own --fbre-* rules   your stylesheet
```

- **Layer 1–2 (presets)** seed the *entire* token set with a coherent light or dark palette. Picking `colorScheme` swaps which one is active.
- **Layer 3 (knobs)** are written as **inline** custom properties on the container, so they beat any stylesheet rule targeting the same element — no selector can out-specify an inline declaration.
- **Layer 4 (raw CSS)** beats the presets and is the escape hatch for every token no knob touches. For a token a knob *has* set, a stylesheet rule on `.fbre-container` loses to the inline knob — to override a knob-set token you need `!important`, or set the token on a **descendant** element so it takes effect lower in the tree.

This is why you can set `colorScheme: "dark"` and then override just `surface` and `text` — the rest of the form stays coherent with the dark preset, and your two knobs take effect on top.

---

## 1. Color scheme (presets)

`theme.colorScheme` selects the built-in starter palette. Default is `"light"`.

```tsx
// Via the theme prop (takes precedence over flow config)
<FBRE flow={flow} theme={{ colorScheme: "dark" }} onFlowComplete={done} />

// Via the flow config
const flow = { ...base, config: { ...base.config, theme: { colorScheme: "dark" } } };
```

It applies `data-mode="light" | "dark"` on the `.fbre-container` and seeds all `--fbre-*` tokens with light- or dark-appropriate values.

> **Migration:** `colorScheme` replaces the former `darkMode: boolean`. `darkMode: true` → `colorScheme: "dark"`; `darkMode: false`/absent → `colorScheme: "light"`. There is no runtime fallback — pre-migrate stored flows.

There is intentionally **no `"auto"`** scheme yet (following the viewer's `prefers-color-scheme`). It is an additive future option; today a flow renders one chosen scheme for every viewer.

---

## 2. Palette knobs

Knobs live on `theme` and override individual tokens **on top of** the active preset. Set any subset; unset knobs fall through.

```tsx
<FBRE
  flow={flow}
  theme={{
    colorScheme: "dark",
    color: "#bcd3cd",       // accent
    background: "#1a2a3a",  // form ground
    surface: "#243244",     // input fills / cards
    text: "#e8ede9",
    border: "#2e4158",
    radius: "3px",
    fontFamily: '"Inter", system-ui, sans-serif',
  }}
  onFlowComplete={done}
/>
```

Each knob sets a **primary token** and **derives** the related tokens from it, so you get a coherent result from a single value:

| Knob | Primary token | Also derives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | `--fbre-theme-color` | `--fbre-theme-light`, `--fbre-theme-dark` |
| `background` | `--fbre-bg` | — |
| `surface` | `--fbre-surface` | `--fbre-surface-hover/-alt/-subtle`, `--fbre-control-surface`, `--fbre-input-bg`, `--fbre-input-bg-focus` |
| `text` | `--fbre-text` | `--fbre-text-secondary/-placeholder/-disabled`, `--fbre-label` |
| `border` | `--fbre-border` | `--fbre-border-hover/-light/-subtle` |
| `radius` | `--fbre-radius` | — |
| `fontFamily` | `--fbre-font` | — |
| `error` | `--fbre-error` | `--fbre-error-light` |
| `success` | `--fbre-success` | `--fbre-success-bg`, `--fbre-success-border` |
| `warning` | `--fbre-warning` | `--fbre-warning-bg`, `--fbre-warning-border` |

### How derivation works

Knobs are applied as inline custom properties on the container; derived tokens are emitted as `color-mix()` expressions that reference other tokens rather than literal colors — e.g. `--fbre-text-secondary` is roughly `color-mix(in srgb, var(--fbre-text) 64%, var(--fbre-bg))`. Because the inputs are *tokens*, derivations stay **mode-aware**: if you set only `surface`, its derived hover/alt surfaces still mix against the active scheme's `--fbre-bg`/`--fbre-text`. A knob's derived tokens are emitted **only when that knob is set**, so an unset knob leaves the preset's values untouched. The mapping lives in one place: `buildThemeVars()` in `fbre/src/lib/theme-vars.ts`.

> Knobs are *colors and a few scalars*, not shape. To change borders-vs-underlines, fills, or spacing rhythm, choose a different `theme.style` — see the orthogonal-axes note above.

---

## 3. Raw CSS escape hatch

For anything not exposed as a knob — or for surgical control — override the `--fbre-*` tokens directly in your own stylesheet. Scope to your wrapper so you out-specify the engine's defaults regardless of load order:

```css
.my-form-wrapper .fbre-container {
  --fbre-surface: #243244;
  --fbre-star-filled: #bcd3cd;   /* not a knob — set it raw */
  --fbre-shadow-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}
```

Knobs are applied inline on the container, so a knob and a raw stylesheet rule targeting the *same* token on the same element will see the knob win regardless of selector specificity — override a knob-set token with `!important` or by setting it on a descendant element. In practice: use knobs for the common palette, raw CSS for the long tail of tokens no knob touches.

---

## Token catalog

Every themeable value, with light and dark preset defaults. Tokens marked **(derived)** are produced from a knob when that knob is set; you can also set any of them raw.

### Accent

| Token | Light | Dark | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fbre-theme-color` | `#1976d2` | `#42a5f5` | `color` |
| `--fbre-theme-light` | `#e3f2fd` | `#1a2332` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-theme-dark` | `#1565c0` | `#1e88e5` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-on-primary` | `#fff` | `#fff` | — |

### Ground & surfaces

| Token | Light | Dark | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fbre-bg` | `#fff` | `#121212` | `background` |
| `--fbre-surface` | `#fff` | `#1e1e1e` | `surface` |
| `--fbre-surface-hover` | `#f5f5f5` | `#2a2a2a` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-surface-alt` | `#e0e0e0` | `#333` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-surface-subtle` | `#e8e8e8` | `#2a2a2a` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-control-surface` | `#fff` | `#e0e0e0` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-input-bg` | `var(--fbre-surface)` | `var(--fbre-surface)` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-input-bg-focus` | `var(--fbre-bg)` | `var(--fbre-bg)` | (derived) |

> Note: some style variants override tokens inside their `[data-style]` block: `defined-outlined` overrides `--fbre-input-bg` and `--fbre-label`, `soft-outlined` overrides `--fbre-input-bg`, and `airy-clean` overrides `--fbre-label`; the outlined variants also adjust `--fbre-layout-gap`. A knob still wins over all of these, because knobs are inline. (Their dark-mode blocks reset input-bg/label back to surface-derived values.)

### Text

| Token | Light | Dark | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fbre-text` | `#212121` | `#e0e0e0` | `text` |
| `--fbre-text-secondary` | `#666` | `#9e9e9e` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-text-placeholder` | `#aaa` | `#666` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-text-disabled` | `#bbb` | `#555` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-label` | `var(--fbre-text-secondary)` | `var(--fbre-text-secondary)` | (derived) |

### Borders

| Token | Light | Dark | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fbre-border` | `#ccc` | `#444` | `border` |
| `--fbre-border-hover` | `#999` | `#666` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-border-light` | `#ddd` | `#444` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-border-subtle` | `#eee` | `#333` | (derived) |

### State colors

| Token | Light | Dark | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fbre-error` | `#d32f2f` | `#ef5350` | `error` |
| `--fbre-error-light` | `#fdecea` | `#2c1b1b` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-success` | `#2d6a28` | `#a8e6a0` | `success` |
| `--fbre-success-bg` | `#ddffda` | `#1a3318` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-success-border` | `#b8e6b4` | `#2d5a28` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-warning` | `#7a5900` | `#ffe082` | `warning` |
| `--fbre-warning-bg` | `#fff8e1` | `#332b00` | (derived) |
| `--fbre-warning-border` | `#ffe082` | `#665500` | (derived) |

### Controls

| Token | Light | Dark | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--fbre-toggle-track` | `#ccc` | `#555` | — |
| `--fbre-star-empty` | `#ddd` | `#444` | — |
| `--fbre-star-filled` | `#ffc107` | `#ffca28` | — |
| `--fbre-slider-track` | `#ddd` | `#444` | — |
| `--fbre-shadow-color` | `rgba(0,0,0,.12)` | `rgba(0,0,0,.4)` | — |

### Shape & motion

| Token | Default | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--fbre-radius` | `4px` | `radius` |
| `--fbre-font` | `"Segoe UI", system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif` | `fontFamily` |
| `--fbre-layout-gap` | `4px` (varies by style) | — |
| `--fbre-transition-duration` | `250ms` | — |
| `--fbre-transition-easing` | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` | — |

The control and motion tokens above have **no dedicated knob** — set them raw if you need to. (Tokens are defined in `fbre/src/styles/base.css`; transition tokens in `transitions.css`.)

## Worked example: a dark brand form

Goal: a sage-on-navy intake form using the `defined-outlined` style. Two equivalent ways to express it.

**With knobs (recommended)** — the engine derives the supporting tokens and keeps the dark scheme coherent:

```tsx
<FBRE
  flow={flow}
  theme={{
    style: "defined-outlined",
    colorScheme: "dark",
    color: "#bcd3cd",
    background: "#1a2a3a",
    surface: "#243244",
    text: "#e8ede9",
    border: "#2e4158",
    radius: "3px",
    fontFamily: '"Inter", system-ui, sans-serif',
  }}
  onFlowComplete={done}
/>
```

**With raw CSS** — equivalent for these tokens, and the only option for non-knob tokens (e.g. recoloring rating stars):

```css
.brand .fbre-container {
  --fbre-bg: #1a2a3a;
  --fbre-surface: #243244;
  --fbre-input-bg: #243244;
  --fbre-text: #e8ede9;
  --fbre-text-secondary: #8fa899;
  --fbre-label: #8fa899;
  --fbre-border: #2e4158;
  --fbre-theme-color: #bcd3cd;
  --fbre-radius: 3px;
  --fbre-font: "Inter", system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

The knob form needs no `data-mode` gymnastics and no per-element selector overrides — input fills, labels, and focus states all follow the tokens.
